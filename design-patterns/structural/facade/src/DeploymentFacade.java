/*
 * Implementing Facade Design Pattern
 *
 * The Facade class — in our case, DeploymentFacade — serves as a single, unified
 * interface to a complex set of operations involved in application deployment.
 * Internally, it holds references to the core building blocks of the deployment
 * pipeline:
 *
 * - VersionControlSystem – Fetches the latest code from a Git branch
 * - BuildSystem – Compiles the code and generates the deployable artifact
 * - TestingFramework – Runs automated tests (unit, integration)
 * - DeploymentTarget – Transfers the artifact and activates it on the target server
 *
 * Rather than forcing the client to call each of these subsystems in the correct order,
 * the facade abstracts this coordination logic and offers a clean, high-level method
 * like deployApplication() that executes the full workflow.
